## Center for Cognition, Computation, and Climate Research (C4R)

_C4R_ is a multidisciplinary research center based in Nepal.

We study human and animal cognition using behavioral and electrophysiological methods and computational modeling.
Our research also focuses on the effects of anthropogenic climate change on people's livelihoods in the least developed countries such as Nepal.

In collaboration with researchers at home and abroad, we aim to establish ourselves as the center of excellence in cognitive and climate science research and computational modeling of complex phenomena.

At this early stage of our institute, we invite collaborators, funders, and well-wishers to contribute to our growth and development in any form they can.
